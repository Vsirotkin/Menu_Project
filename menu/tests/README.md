### Step 1: Test File

Created a file named `tests.py` in the `menu/tests` directory.

### Step 2: Tests


### Explanation of the Tests

1. **Setup Method**: The `setUp` method initializes the `Client` object, which is used to make HTTP requests to the views.
2. **Test Methods**: Each test method checks:
   - The response status code to ensure the view returns a 200 OK status.
   - The template used to ensure the correct template is rendered.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py test menu.tests
```

This command will execute all the tests in the `menu/tests` app and provide feedback on whether they passed or failed.

### Additional Notes

- **Named URLs**: The `reverse` function is used to get the URL for each view based on its name. This ensures that the tests are not dependent on the URL paths directly.
- **Template Checking**: The `assertTemplateUsed` method checks that the correct template is used for each view.
